# Face Detection App

This is one of my personal projects. It is a web app which can detect a face on the image inserted. There is a register/signin feature too. Quick technical facts about the project:

- Frontend part of the project is built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
- Backend is realized with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home). GitHub repo with the code can be found [here](https://github.com/dimianni/dimianniFaceDetectorApi).

## To clone the repo, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimianni/facedetector-app.git
```

## Usage

There are just a few commands to be aware of:

```bash
npm run start
```

Will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

```bash
npm run test
```

Will launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

```bash
npm run build
```
Will create a production build.
